  My name is [Arash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arash) (aka NEO).
  I recently joined Oracle as a Member of Technical Staff (IC3) working on
  [MySQL HeatWave](https://www.oracle.com/mysql/heatwave/).
  Prior to that, I was a PhD candidate at the
  [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](http://ic.epfl.ch/),
  [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/), and a doctoral research assistant at
  [PARSA](http://parsa.epfl.ch) under supervision of
  [Prof. Babak Falsafi](http://parsa.epfl.ch/~falsafi/).
  I did my master's in Software Engineering at the Department of CSE and IT of
  [Shiraz University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_University),
  where I also received my B.Sc. in Software Engineering.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*

# Interests Section
# interests_title: Research Interests
interests_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am broadly interested in the field of computer systems and interdisciplinary
  systems-level problems found in modern, large-scale datacenters, from cloud services
  to data stores and all the way down to server systems.
  By characterizing modern datacenter applications, I look for maximizing the
  compute density of server systems and minimizing their energy footprint through
  specialization of various system components and better system integration.
  The focus of my PhD thesis was on the evasion of the RPC tax in datacenters
  through hardware-software co-design.
