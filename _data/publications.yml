    The emerging paradigm of microservices decomposes online services into fine-grained
    software modules frequently communicating over the datacenter network,
    often using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). Ongoing advancements in the network stack
    have exposed the RPC layer itself as a bottleneck, that we show accounts for 40–90%
    of a microservice's total execution cycles. We break down the underlying modules
    that comprise production RPC layers and demonstrate, based on prior evidence,
    that CPUs can only expect limited improvements for such tasks, mandating a shift to
    hardware to remove the RPC layer as a limiter of microservice performance.
    Although recently proposed accelerators can efficiently handle a portion of
    the RPC layer, their overall benefit is limited by unnecessary CPU involvement, which
    occurs because the accelerators are architected as co-processors under the CPU's
    control. Instead, we show that conclusively removing the RPC layer bottleneck requires
    all of the RPC layer's modules to be executed by a NIC-attached hardware accelerator.
    We introduce Cerebros, a dedicated RPC processor that executes the Apache Thrift RPC
    layer and acts as an intermediary stage between the NIC and the microservice running
    on the CPU. Our evaluation using the DeathStarBench microservice suite shows that
    Cerebros reduces the CPU cycles spent in the RPC layer by 37–64×, yielding a 1.8–14×
    reduction in total cycles expended per microservice request.

    DNN inference accelerators executing online services exhibit low average loads
    because of service demand variability, leading to poor resource utilization.
    Unfortunately, reclaiming idle inference cycles is difficult as other workloads
    can not execute on a custom accelerator. With recent proposals for the use of
    fixed-point arithmetic in training, there are opportunities for training services
    to piggyback on inference accelerators. We make the observation that a key challenge
    in doing so is maintaining service-level latency constraints for inference.
    We show that relaxing latency constraints in an inference accelerator with ALU arrays
    that are batching-optimized achieves near-optimal throughput for a given area
    and power envelope while maintaining inference services' tail latency goals.
    We present Equinox, a custom inference accelerator designed to piggyback training.
    Equinox employs a uniform arithmetic encoding to accommodate inference and training
    and a priority hardware scheduler with adaptive batching that interleaves training
    during idle inference cycles. For a 500𝜇𝑠 inference service time constraint,
    Equinox achieves 6.67× higher throughput than a latency-optimal inference accelerator.
    Despite not being optimized for training services, Equinox achieves up to 78% of
    the throughput of a dedicated training accelerator that saturates the available
    compute resources and DRAM bandwidth. Finally, Equinox’s controller logic incurs
    less than 1% power and area overhead, while the uniform encoding (to enable training)
    incurs 13% power and 4% area overhead compared to a fixed-point inference accelerator.

    Data transformer apparatus comprising at least a dispatcher module (D),
    a reader module (R), a converter module (C) and a writer module (W).
    The dispatcher module (D) is configured to: receive a data transformation request
    (DTR) including: a first information item (X1) associated to a memory address where
    data to be transformed (Data1) are stored and to a type attribute (T) of said data to
    be transformed (Data1); a second information item (X2) indicating a memory address
    where transformed data (Data2), obtained from said data to be transformed (Data1),
    have to be written. The reader module (R) is configured to: retrieve the data to be
    transformed, according to said first information item (X1); obtain the type attribute
    (T) of the data to be transformed (Data1), based on said first information item (X1);
    send the data to be transformed (Data1) and the type attribute (T) thereof to the
    converter module (C). The converter module (C) is configured to: select one or more
    transformation instructions (INST) based on said type attribute (T); execute,
    on the data to be transformed (Data1), the selected one or more transformation
    instructions (INST), thereby obtaining the transformed data (Data2);
    send the transformed data (Data2) to the writer module (W). The writer module (W)
    is configured to: receive the transformed data (Data2) from the converter module (C);
    write the transformed data (Data2) in an output buffer according to said
    second information item (X2).

    Modern online services are shifting away from monolithic applications to
    hundreds of loosely-coupled microservices because of the benefits they bring
    in the form of scalability, reliability, programmability and deployment.
    Because of the reduction in service time, the improvements in speed in
    emerging network fabrics and communication protocols,
    the data transformation software converting object formats from one microservice
    to another is becoming a bottleneck.
    In this paper, we introduce Optimus Prime (OP), a programmable accelerator
    for data transformation that uses a novel hardware abstraction,
    an in-memory schema specifying the operations required for data transformation.
    The schema enables the accelerator front-end to maximize memory-level parallelism
    through multiple pointer chains and gather data conversion tuples for
    a parallel back-end. We show that OP can achieve a transformation throughput
    at the network card line rate and has 100x higher throughput compared to software
    at a tiny fraction of the CPU's silicon overhead or power.
    We evaluate microservices on Thrift and show up to 30% reduction
    in overall service latency.

    The popularity of online services drives the need for bigger datacenters with more server processors.
    As Moore’s law continues, the number of transistors on chip rises exponentially,
    enabling us to have CMPs with hundreds of cores.
    However, due to the slowdown in Dennard’s scaling, we cannot power up all of them at the same time.
    Hence, soon we will enter an era of “dark silicon”, in which we cannot power up fast and dense processors.
    In this work, we explore the potential directions to improve the energy efficiency of
    server processors in the post-Dennard era. Moreover, we investigate the hardware- and software-related
    constraints of designing a server processor for modern cloud services,
    and we propose an approach based on near-threshold computing (NTC) to
    design energy efficient server processors.
    We propose an architecture based on the FD-SOI process technology for NTC in servers.
    Our study demonstrates the benefits of NTC and proposes several directions to
    synergistically increase the energy proportionality of a near-threshold server.
