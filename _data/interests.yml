  #   I am broadly interested in the field of systems and interdisciplinary systems problems found in modern,
  #   large-scale datacenters.
  #   My current research revolves around efficiency and sustainability enhancement of server systems for datacenters.
  #   By characterizing modern server workloads and employing emerging memory subsystems,
  #   I look for minimizing the energy footprint and maximizing the compute density of server systems
  #   through specialization of various system components, and better system integration.
