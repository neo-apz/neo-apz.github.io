  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    CloudSuite is a benchmark suite of cloud services.
    The benchmarks are based on real-world software stacks and represent real-world setups.
    It is one of the early benchmark suites that is representative of modern datacenter services and
    is included in Google's PerfKit Benchmarker.
    It has become an industry standard and been used to drive the design of modern datacenter-oriented CPUs,
    such as Cavium ThunderX.
    I have been in the core team responsible for the maintenance and the third release of CloudSuite,
    which is a major enhancement over prior releases both in benchmarks and infrastructure.

    The QFlex project targets quick, accurate, and flexible simulation of multi-node computer systems
    proceeding along four fronts: QEMU, a popular open-source full-system machine emulator,
    Flexus, a powerful and flexible simulation framework that enables detailed cycle-accurate simulation,
    SMARTS, which applies rigorous statistical sampling theory to reduce the simulation time while achieving
    high accuracy, and NS-3, a popular and flexible network simulation stack.
    I have been a member of the Flexus maintenance team and the team responsible for its new version
    branded as QFlex.

    The popularity of online services drives the need for bigger datacenters with more server processors.
    As Moore's law continues, the number of transistors on chip rises exponentially,
    enabling us to have CMPs with hundreds of cores.
    However, due to the slowdown in Dennard's scaling, we cannot power up all of them at the same time.
    Hence, soon we will enter an era of “dark silicon”, in which we cannot power up fast and dense processors.
    In this work, we explore the potential directions to improve the energy efficiency of
    server processors in the post-Dennard era. Moreover, we investigate the hardware- and software-related
    constraints of designing a server processor for modern cloud services,
    and we propose an approach based on near-threshold computing (NTC) to
    design energy efficient server processors.
    We propose an architecture based on the FD-SOI process technology for NTC in servers.
    Our study demonstrates the benefits of NTC and proposes several directions to
    synergistically increase the energy proportionality of a near-threshold server.
